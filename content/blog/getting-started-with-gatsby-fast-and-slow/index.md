To start, you need:
- Git
- Node and NPM

Getting a site running with Gatsby is as fast as following these two steps:

1. Pull up a starter
```
gatsby new my-hello-world-starter https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world
```

2. Navigate to the project's directory and start the site up.
```
cd my-hello-world-starter/
gatsby develop
```

    Setting up `gatsby-source-filesystem` allows you to query file nodes through GraphQL. It adds these fields:
        - allFile
        - directory
        - file

Source plugins pull data from a data source into the Gatsby data system.
Transformer plugins transform this raw data into something more usable
