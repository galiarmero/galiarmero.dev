    - Express
    - GraphQL
    - React
    - Gatsby

  aboutPersonal: >-
    I grew up in the small town of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaman,_Camarines_Sur">Canaman</a>
    in Camarines Sur province. Soon after graduating at the <a href="https://www.adnu.edu.ph/">Ateneo de Naga University</a>
    in 2014, I took my printed maps and talents to Manila and joined <a href="https://www.nokia.com/networks/">Nokia</a>
    where I am currently working on a suite of troubleshooting and analytics tools for telecom service providers worldwide.


    When not coding, I enjoy eating, exploring new places, listening to podcasts,
    playing basketball, and following my Lakers.


    I also write about my learnings, insights and experiences in my <a href="#latestBlogPosts">blog</a>.
