            <p>
                Hello! My name is Gali -- short for Galileo. I'm a full stack developer from the Philippines. I find joy in creating systems that make people's lives easier.
                I specialize in building performant backends and hiding complexity with clean, intuitive user interfaces. Here are some of the technologies I work with:
    
                <ul>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                    <li>Node.js</li>
                    <li>Express</li>
                    <li>GraphQL</li>
                    <li>React</li>
                    <li>Gatsby</li>
                    <li>Docker</li>
                    <li>HTML & CSS</li>
                    <li>Java & Spring</li>
                </ul>
    
                I write about my learnings, insights and experiences in my blog.

            <p>
                I grew up in the small town of Canaman in Camarines Sur province.
                After graduating at the Ateneo de Naga University in 2014, I took my printed maps and talents to Manila and joined Nokia
                where I am currently working on a suite of troubleshooting and analytics tools for telecom service providers worldwide.
 
                When not coding, I enjoy eating, exploring new places, listening to podcasts, playing basketball, and following my Lakers.
